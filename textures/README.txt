This directory contains textures used by the Worldgate mod.

worldgate_transfer.png
  - This is the background image shown when a player initiates a server transfer
  - Recommended size: 1920x1080 or larger
  - Format: PNG (for transparency support) or JPG
  - The image should be visually appealing and portal/transfer themed

To Add the Image:
-----------------

1. Take your transfer.jpeg file
2. Rename it to: worldgate_transfer.png
   (or convert it to PNG format for best results)
3. Place it in this textures/ directory

The image will be displayed as a fullscreen background when players click
on a servergate beacon to transfer to another server.

If the image is missing, players will still see the transfer information,
but without the visual background.
